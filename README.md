# Glaucoma Detection Using Fundus Images

This project focuses on **automatic glaucoma detection** using retinal fundus images with the help of **image processing and deep learning techniques**.  
The goal is to assist early diagnosis of glaucoma, which can help prevent permanent vision loss.

🧠 Problem Statement

Glaucoma is a serious eye disease that damages the optic nerve and often shows **no early symptoms**.  
Manual diagnosis is time-consuming and requires expert ophthalmologists.

👉 This project aims to **automate glaucoma detection** using fundus images.
